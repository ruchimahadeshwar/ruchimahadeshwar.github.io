         Despite near-global bans, a $180 billion market for sex employs workers who often report preferring sex work's amenities over those of other available work. This suggests that bans may not align with workers' valuations of sex work. In this paper, we estimate how workers trade off sex vs. non-sex work using a cluster RCT in Cambodia that increases the relative returns to non-sex work. We find that incentivizing workers' outside option increases overall earnings by 13%, and in turn, decreases sex work by 13%, relative to both pure control and unconditional cash transfer arms. This suggests that the incentives' price effects are not driven by income effects. We thus interpret reduced form effects to reflect sex work's relative disutility. We then estimate sex (-0.58) and non-sex work (0.46) labor supply elasticities. We also structurally estimate the relative disutility of sex work in a model of worker labor supply choice. Both exercises validate that sex work's relative disutility is positive and large. However, estimates of compensating wage differentials imply a trade-off between fatality risk and price that is double existing estimates. This implies that sex workers internalize the costs of market participation, independent of bans. Thus, our results demonstrate that, first, incentivizing outside options decreases sex work supply, and second, bans are mismatched with worker valuations.

         Using a field experiment among garment factory workers in Cambodia, we estimate the effects of randomly disclosing spousal income on productivity in a standardized work task. Recent work has shown the significant effect of information asymmetry on spousal bargaining. However, the impact of this asymmetry on productivity, and subsequently the overall pool of resources available for bargaining, is often overlooked.  We find that the disclosure of income significantly impacts how much income is earned compared to a nondisclosure scenario where spouses can decide the amount they report to their spouse, and, therefore, how it is allocated. The effects differ dramatically by gender: when income is disclosed to their spouses, women tend to decrease productivity. By contrast, men do the opposite: when income is disclosed, they increase productivity. We reconcile these findings with a model where spousesâ€™ bargaining power and the cost of misreporting income determine their effort in anticipation of whether they can be the residual claimant of that income or be forced to bargain over it. Overall, this study sheds light on the unintended consequences of financial or pay transparency policies on both productivity and household inequality.

          Performance-based pay is often considered the "magic cure" for low productivity in many sectors. However, despite past studies supporting the effectiveness of performance pay in motivating individual worker effort, its overall impact on the organizational level remains uncertain, particularly given the long and multifaceted transition from the most common pay structure, fixed pay, to performance pay. This paper presents a unique natural experiment in the Cambodian garment manufacturing sector, where a large factory implements two major interventions that break down the mechanisms of the transition to performance-based pay system:  a worker performance monitoring system and a performance-based wage scheme.  Leveraging the staggered roll-out of these interventions, our findings reveal that both performance monitoring and performance pay significantly improve productivity. This improvement is driven not only by motivating individual effort but also by changing turnover rates among less productive workers and improving the alignment of workers with production lines.

          Information frictions are common in many markets. In areas with a high prevalence of both HIV and transactional sex, we examine the effects of new diagnostics that enable sexual partners to learn each otherâ€™s HIV status. We find that access to at-home HIV tests increases womenâ€™s income from transactional sex, without negatively affecting their health outcomes. The higher income stems from both more transactional sex and reduced condom use. The decrease in condom use occurs mainly with ex ante high-risk partners who test HIV-negative, suggesting that the new diagnostics enable women to overcome the risk-income trade-off associated with transactional sex.
